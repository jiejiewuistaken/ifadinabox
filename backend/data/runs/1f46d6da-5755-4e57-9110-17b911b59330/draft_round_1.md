# COSOP (Draft) — Test COSOP

## 1. Country context
This COSOP draft concerns **Testland**. It is prepared as an MVP simulation and should be refined with country diagnostics and stakeholder consultations.

User-provided notes:

Notes about inclusivity and climate.


## 2. IFAD engagement and lessons learned (from CCR/CSPE where available)
Key lessons learned are synthesized from available documentation provided to the system (e.g., CCR/CSPE references where available). Where gaps exist, the CDT should commission background studies and validate findings through consultations.


## 3. Strategic objectives and theory of change
### Strategic objectives
- SO1: Improve inclusive rural livelihoods and incomes.
- SO2: Strengthen resilience to climate and market shocks.

### Theory of change (high level)
If investments expand access to services, finance, markets, and climate-smart practices, then smallholders—especially women and youth—can increase productivity and incomes while reducing vulnerability.


## 4. Implementation arrangements
Implementation will be coordinated by the Country Delivery Team (CDT) under the CD’s leadership. The approach will align with IFAD procedures and emphasize partner coordination, learning, and adaptive management.


## 5. Risks and mitigation (incl. safeguards)
- **Safeguards / inclusion risk**: Risk of exclusion of vulnerable groups. Mitigation: explicit targeting, inclusive consultation, grievance redress.
- **Climate risk**: Increased climate variability. Mitigation: climate-smart investments, risk screening.
- **Institutional risk**: Limited capacity. Mitigation: capacity building and phased implementation.


## 6. Annex: Evidence excerpts (RAG citations)
[E1] (_smoke_input.txt) This is a small test document about country context, objectives, implementation, risks, and safeguards.
