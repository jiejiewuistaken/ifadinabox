Agent knowledge base folders
============================

Each subfolder holds reference files for a specific agent or access scope.
Files can be PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, or PPTX. The simulation ingests these files
and applies authorization scopes based on the folder name.

Add your materials here before running a simulation. Keep filenames stable
so they are easy to reference in logs and evidence citations.
